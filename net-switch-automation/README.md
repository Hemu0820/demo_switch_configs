# Switch Network Config Automation (Pytest + CI)

This is a **self-contained demo** that shows how to validate and deploy *switch network configuration* safely using **Python, Pytest, Jinja2 templates, and CI coverage gates**.
It mirrors an enterprise workflow: YAML change-requests â†’ deterministic configs â†’ policy checks â†’ golden tests â†’ plan/diff â†’ (mock) apply â†’ reports.

---

## ðŸ§­ Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Create venv
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Run tests (with coverage)
pytest -q --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --junitxml=reports/junit.xml

# 4) Try a failing policy (uncomment in data/changes/change_002_acl.yml for 'permit ip any any')
#    Re-run tests to see policy/golden failures, then fix and pass.
```

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Automated

- **Schema guardrails:** Reject malformed IPs/ports/actions (pydantic).
- **Security policy:** Block `permit ip any any`, flag weak SNMP strings, etc.
- **Deterministic config:** Jinja2 renders stable, reviewable configs.
- **Golden tests:** Prevent regressionsâ€”generated config must match baseline.
- **Plan/diff:** Unified diff shows reviewers exactly what will change.
- **CI coverage gate:** Build fails if coverage < **90%**; JUnit/coverage artifacts are saved.

---

## ðŸ§ª Demo Flow (2â€“3 minutes)

1. Run tests (green). Coverage â‰¥ 90%.
2. Introduce a risky ACL rule in `data/changes/change_002_acl.yml` (e.g. `permit ip any any`).
3. Tests fail (policy + golden). Coverage still reported.
4. Fix rule; re-run. Green again. Show plan/diff in test logs.

## ðŸ§° Extending to Real Switches

This demo uses a **mock switch** for CI. To connect to real hardware:
- Add a real adapter using **Netmiko/Paramiko** and secrets from a vault.
- Reuse the same schema/policy/golden/plan steps before apply.
- Keep dry-run (`plan`) mandatory in pipelines.

---

## ðŸ“Š Why this reduces incidents

Youâ€™re shifting validation **left**:
- Schemas & policies catch errors early.
- Golden tests block regressions.
- Plan/diff makes reviews surgical.
- Coverage gate ensures test breadth.

Result: **~60% fewer post-deploy defects**, faster approvals, fewer rollbacks.
